 <h3>Coming to America</h3>
 <p>This is the best comedy movie ever!</p>
 <h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
 <p>The most iconic quote from this movie is likely Jules' (Samuel L. Jackson) Bible verse of Ezekiel 25:17. "The Path of The Righteous Man..."</p>
 <h3>Inception</h3>
 <p>I really like Christopher Nolan movies and this is one of his best.</p>
